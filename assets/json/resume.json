He develops complete visuotactile teleoperation systems—including firmware, communication protocols, simulation setup, force-feedback computation, and kinematic modelling—to generate high-fidelity demonstration data. His research spans visuotactile policy learning, multimodal sensor fusion (vision, force, tactile), and data-efficient imitation and reinforcement learning tailored to contact-rich, dexterous manipulation tasks in simulation and reality. Currently, two related works have been submitted to ICRA 2026 as he prepares to apply for a fall 2026 PhD focused on robotics, RL, and dexterous manipulation.","profiles":[{"network":"Linkedin","username":"danielhyt","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhyt/"}]},"work":[{"name":"Industrial Technology Research Institute(ITRI)","position":"Intern","url":"https://www.itri.org.tw/","startDate":"2023-08-14","endDate":"2023-12-19","summary":"Contributed to the self-driving automobile group by applying reinforcement learning for behavioral prediction of autonomous vehicles.
