    "summary": "As an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at National Taiwan University, I have amassed substantial research experience through my work at NTU-RobotLearning-Lab and the Advanced Control Laboratory. My innovative edge is showcased by a portfolio of side projects, including a prize-winning VR Quidditch simulator and the “Magic Hand” gesture-controlled presentation system. My practical problem-solving capabilities have been further honed through internships at CAVEDU, where I focused on AI education, and at Industrial Technology Research Institute(ITRI), working on autonomous vehicle systems.",
