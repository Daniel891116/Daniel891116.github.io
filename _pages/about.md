My name is Yao-Ting(Daniel) Huang, an aspiring Electrical Engineer from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), dedicated to merging the analytical rigors of engineering with the transformative potential of AI and Robotics. My academic path and research endeavors, under the tutelage of esteemed professors, have empowered me to navigate the complexities of Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and the innovative domain of Computer Vision. The side projects displayed [here](https://daniel891116.github.io/projects/), including an award-winning VR Quidditch simulator and the intuitive "Magic Hand" presentation system, are testaments to my commitment to technological innovation. Dive into my portfolio to explore how my internships and collaborative projects are shaping my journey towards developing intelligent, adaptive robotic systems for the real world.
