I’m Yao-Ting (Daniel) Huang, an ECE M.S. student at UC San Diego (ISRC) developing visuotactile robot policies for dexterous, contact-rich manipulation. Before joining UCSD, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University, where I conducted research in the <a href="https://nturll.netlify.app/about">NTU Robot Learning Lab</a> under Prof. <a href="https://shaohua0116.github.io/">Shau-Hua Sun</a> and in the <a href="http://www.ntueeacl.com/26368260322804024687-news.html">Advanced Control Lab</a> under Prof. <a href="http://www.ntueeacl.com/25351235662594525480-advisor.html">Li-Chen Fu</a>. My undergraduate studies explored unsupervised reinforcement learning and vision-based UAV navigation, giving me early experience in algorithmic design, perception, and control for autonomous systems. These projects laid the foundation for my current work at UCSD, where I integrate tactile feedback, imitation learning, and sim-to-real transfer to advance robot dexterity.

### Research focus
- Visuotactile policy learning for dexterous manipulation under contact-rich dynamics
- Multimodal fusion of vision, force and tactile feedback for robust slip and contact-state estimation, enabling data-efficient imitation learning and sim-to-real transfer for surgical and in-hand tasks
- End-to-end teleoperation system development (firmware, communication, simulation setup, force-feedback computation, and kinematics modelling)

### Recent work
During my first year at UCSD, I joined the <a href="https://ucsdarclab.com/">ARCLab</a> advised by Prof. <a href="https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/professor-michael-yip">Michael Yip</a> and worked closely with <a href="https://soofiyan.github.io/SoofiyanAtar/">Soofiyan Atar</a>. As a Graduate Researcher, I developed the N2D haptic glove teleoperation system, building its complete hardware-software pipeline—including firmware, communication protocols, Isaac Sim integration, force-feedback computation, and kinematic modeling. This system enables precise bidirectional teleoperation between a human operator and a dexterous robotic hand for contact-rich surgical and manipulation tasks. Apart from that, I collect visuotactile demonstrations to train imitation policies that generalize across simulation and real-world settings. Two related works are currently under review for ICRA 2026.
