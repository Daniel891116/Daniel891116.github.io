As an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), I have amassed substantial research experience through my work at NTU-RobotLearning-Lab and the [Advanced Control Laboratory](http://www.ntueeacl.com/). My innovative edge is showcased by a portfolio of side projects, including a prize-winning VR Quidditch simulator and the "Magic Hand" gesture-controlled presentation system. My practical problem-solving capabilities have been further honed through internships at CAVEDU, where I focused on AI education, and at ITRI, working on autonomous vehicle systems.
