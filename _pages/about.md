I'm Yao‑Ting (Daniel) Huang, an ECE M.S. student at UC San Diego (ISRC). I build visuotactile robot policies for dexterous, contact‑rich manipulation.

### Research focus
- Visuotactile policy learning for dexterous manipulation under contact-rich dynamics
- Multimodal fusion of vision, force and tactile feedback for robust slip and contact-state estimation, enabling data-efficient imitation learning and sim-to-real transfer for surgical and in-hand tasks
- End-to-end teleoperation system development (firmware, communication, simulation setup, force-feedback computation, and kinematics modelling)

### Recent work
During my first year at UCSD, I joined the <a href="https://ucsdarclab.com/">ARCLab</a> advised by <a href="https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/professor-michael-yip">Prof. Michael Yip</a> and worked closely with <a href="https://soofiyan.github.io/SoofiyanAtar/">Soofiyan Atar</a>. As a Graduate Researcher, I developed the N2D haptic glove teleoperation system, building its complete hardware-software pipeline—including firmware, communication protocols, Isaac Sim integration, force-feedback computation, and kinematic modeling. This system enables precise bidirectional teleoperation between a human operator and a dexterous robotic hand for contact-rich surgical and manipulation tasks. Apart from that, I collect visuotactile demonstrations to train imitation policies that generalize across simulation and real-world settings. Two related works are currently under review for ICRA 2026.
